# OSPP Proposals Sharing

[![Chinese version](http://cdn.mr8god.cn/img/chinese.svg)](README-zh.md)

Hi everyone, I'm Chenwei, a student who is passionate about open source technology. So you can often see me in various open source technology exchange groups (if you can not see, please pull me in hahaha).
Not much to say, cut to the chase. This time, I'm sharing some of the applications I found online when I applied to OSPP last year, so I'm sharing them. If there is a problem from the perspective of privacy or copyright, please tell me directly haha, this is my email: cheverjohn@outlook.com.

Well, the new OSPP application is about to start, so go for it!

Ps: Notes

1. a lot of personal information has expired, such as my personal website and GitHub account in the application, so please check it out for yourself. 2;
2. Although my application is also included, I don't think it's very good, so just take a look.
